The :guilabel:`Connections Sidebar` shows MongoDB deployments that
you can interact with through MongoDB Compass. 

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/multiple-connections.rst


The :guilabel:`Connections` sidebar on the left of the Compass window
contains the following options:

- :icon-lg:`Plus` icon to add new connections
- :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` icon to import and export data
- Search bar to search connections
- List of favorite and saved connections


Connections List
----------------

The :guilabel:`Connections` list in the sidebar contains all your
:ref:`favorite <favorite-connections>` and saved connections. Favorite
connections have a :icon-fa5:`star` next to the connection name.  The
:guilabel:`Connections` list displays favorite connections in alphabetical
order first. 

To connect to a deployment, click the name of the connection in the
:guilabel:`Connections` menu. Once you connect, Compass shows a green
dot next to the connection name. If a connection error occurs, Compass
shows a red triangle next to the connection name. 

To add a new connection to Compass, click the :icon-lg:`Plus` button to
open the :guilabel:`New Connection` modal. For more information, see
:ref:`connect-run-compass`. 

To remove a connection, hover over the name of the connection in the 
:guilabel:`Connections` menu. Then, click on the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` to
open a menu and select the :guilabel:`Remove` option. This menu also contains the
following options:

- Edit connection
- Copy connection string
- Favorite (or Unfavorite)
- Duplicate
