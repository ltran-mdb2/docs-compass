The :guilabel:`Connections Sidebar` on the left of the Compass window
contains the following options:

- :guilabel:`Active Connections` menu
- :guilabel:`Connections` menu
- :icon-lg:`Plus` icon to add new connections

Active Connections Menu
-----------------------

When you connect to a MongoDB deployment, the connection name appears in
the :guilabel:`Active Connections` menu at the top of
:guilabel:`Connections Sidebar`.

If you click the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` button on the right of a
connection name, a menu with the following items opens:

- View performance metrics
- Show connection info
- Copy connection string
- Favorite 
- Disconnect

If the connection is already a favorite connection, the
option to unfavorite appears in the menu. 

To see databases and collections within the active connection, click the
:icon-fa5:`caret-down` on the left of the connection name. 

To switch between active clusters, click on the name of the cluster you
want to work with in the :guilabel:`Active Connections` menu. 

Connections Menu
----------------

The :guilabel:`Connections` menu contains all :ref:`favorite
<favorite-connections>` and saved connections that you previously used
in Compass. You can see both active and inactive connections in this
menu. The :guilabel:`Connections` menu lists favorite connections in
alphabetical order first. 

To connect to a deployment, click the name of the connection in the
:guilabel:`Connections` menu. Once you connect, the name
of the connection appears in the :guilabel:`Active Connections` menu.

To add a new connection to Compass, click the :icon-lg:`Plus` button to
open the :guilabel:`New Connection` modal. For more information, see
:ref:`connect-run-compass`. 

To remove a connection, hover over the name of the connection in the 
:guilabel:`Connections` menu. Then, click on the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` to
open a menu and select the :guilabel:`Remove` option. This menu also contains the
following options:

- Edit connection
- Copy connection string
- Favorite (or Unfavorite)
- Duplicate
