The :guilabel:`Connections Sidebar` shows MongoDB deployments that

The :guilabel:`Connections` sidebar on the left of the Compass window
contains the following options:

- :icon-lg:`Plus` icon to add new connections
- :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` icon to import and export data
- Search bar to search connections
- List of favorite and saved connections

Connections List
----------------

The :guilabel:`Connections` list in the sidebar contains your
:ref:`favorite <favorite-connections>` and saved connections. Favorite
connections have a :icon-fa5:`star` next to the connection name.  The
:guilabel:`Connections` list displays favorite connections in alphabetical
order first. 

Connect to MongoDB
------------------

To connect to a saved or favorite deployment, click the name of the
connection in the :guilabel:`Connections` list. Once you connect,
Compass shows a green dot next to the connection name. If a connection
error occurs, Compass shows a red triangle next to the connection name. 

To add a new connection to Compass, click the :icon-lg:`Plus` button at
the top of the :guilabel:`Connections Sidebar` to open the
:guilabel:`New Connection` modal. For more information, see
:ref:`connect-run-compass`. 

Connection Options
------------------

To see connection options, hover over the name of the connection in the 
:guilabel:`Connections` list. Then, click on the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` to
open a menu with the following items:

- Open MongoDB shell
- View performance metrics

- Refresh databases
- Disconnect
