Connections Sidebar
-------------------

The :guilabel:`Connections` sidebar on the left of the Compass window
contains the following sections:

- :guilabel:`Active Connections` menu
- :guilabel:`Connections` menu
- :icon-lg:`Plus` icon to add new connections

Active Connections Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To interact with a MongoDB deployment, you must activate the connection.
If the connection you want to activate is in the :guilabel:`Connections`
menu, click the connection name. Otherwise, use the :icon-lg:`Plus` icon
to connect to a new deployment. For more information, see
:ref:`connect-run-compass`. 

When you activate a connection, the connection name appears in the
:guilabel:`Active Connections` menu at the top of
:guilabel:`Connections` sidebar.

If you click the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` button on the right of a
connection name, a menu with the following items opens:

- View performance metrics
- Show connection info
- Copy connection string
- Favorite 
- Disconnect

If the connection is already a favorite connection, the
option to Unfavorite appears in the menu. 

To see databases and collections within the active connection, click the
:icon-fa5:`caret-down` on the left of the connection name. 

To switch between active clusters, click on the name of the cluster you
want to work with in the :guilabel:`Active Connections` menu. 

Connections Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Connections` menu contains all :ref:`favorite
<favorite-connections>` and saved connections that you previously used
in Compass. You can see both active and inactive connections in this
menu. The :guilabel:`Connections` menu lists favorite connections in
alphabetical order first. 

To activate a connection, click the name of the connection in the
:guilabel:`Connections` menu. Once you activate the connection, the name
of the connection apepars in the :guilabel:`Active Connections` menu.

To add a new connection to Compass, click the :icon-lg:`Plus` button to
open the :guilabel:`New Connection` window. For more information, see
:ref:`connect-run-compass`. 

To remove a connection, hover over the name of the connection in the 
:guilabel:`Connections` menu. Then, click on the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` to
open a menu and select the :guilabel:`Remove` option. This menu also contains the
