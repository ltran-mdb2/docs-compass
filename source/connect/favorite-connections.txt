Save a Favorite Connection
--------------------------

You can save a favorite connection from the :guilabel:`New Connection
Modal` or after you have successfully connected to a MongoDB deployment.

Save from Connect Screen

Save after Connecting to a Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Considerations

- .. include:: /includes/fact-connection-keychain-access.rst

- If you run |compass| on KDE Linux, you must have GNOME Keyring
  installed to successfully load saved connections. The Electron module
  `Keytar <https://github.com/atom/node-keytar>`__ uses GNOME Keyring
  to securely store the database credentials for your connections.
