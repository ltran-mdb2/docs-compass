The Compass Home screen provides details regarding the
MongoDB instances to which Compass is connected. 

.. note::

   Starting in version 1.44, you can connect to multiple MongoDB
   instances at once through Compass. When you activate multiple
   connections, Compass displays each active connection in a separate
   tab. 

The Compass Home screen includes the following information:

- The connection name if the connection is a favorite connection,
  or "My Cluster" otherwise.

- Your :ref:`saved queries and aggregation pipelines <view-favorite-queries>`. 

- A list of the instance's :doc:`databases </databases>`.

- :doc:`Performance statistics </performance>`, including memory
  usage, operation counts, and slowest operations.

- A list of your saved and favorite connections.

Once connected to a MongoDB instance, you can reach the Compass
Home screen by clicking the cluster name in the upper left
corner.

Databases Tab
-------------

The :guilabel:`Databases` tab of the Home screen shows a list of all
the databases on the current connection, with each one's storage size,
number of collections, and number of indexes. For more information
about the :guilabel:`Databases` tab and instructions on viewing
a database, see :doc:`Databases </databases>`.
