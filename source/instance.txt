The Compass Home screen provides details regarding the
MongoDB instances to which Compass is connected. 

.. note::

   Starting in version 1.44.0, you can connect to multiple MongoDB
   instances at once through Compass. When you activate multiple
   connections, Compass displays each active connection in a separate
   tab. 

The Compass Home screen includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Connections Sidebar <connections-sidebar>`

- Your :ref:`saved queries and aggregation pipelines <view-favorite-queries>`. 

Once connected to a MongoDB instance, you can reach the Compass
Home screen by clicking a cluster name in the :guilabel:`Connections
Sidebar`. 

Connections Sidebar
-------------------

The top section of the sidebar shows the active MongoDB instances to which
Compass is connected. 

The bottom section of the sidebar lists your saved and favorite
connections. The menu shows both active and inactive connections. To
activate a connection, click the name of the connection. 

For more information on interacting with your connections, see
:ref:`connections-sidebar`.
