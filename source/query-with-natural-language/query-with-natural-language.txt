You can use MongoDB Compass to ask natural language questions about your
data. Compass uses AI to generate filter queries and aggregations based 
on the prompts you provide.

Use Cases
---------

You may want to use natural language to query in Compass to:

- Ask plain text questions about your data.
- Create an initial query or aggregation pipeline that you can 
  modify to suit your requirements.
- Learn how to write complex queries with multiple aggregation stages.

Behavior
--------

- Compass natural language querying is available starting in version 
  ``1.40.x``.

- Natural language querying utilizes `Azure Open AI 
  <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
  as its current provider. This provider may be subject to change in 
  the future.

- The MongoDB Compass natural language querying feature is on a rolling 
  release schedule. As a result, some users may temporarily have functionality
  that other users do not.

Get Started

- :ref:`prompt-natural-language-agg`

Details
-------

When you query your data using natural language in Compass, the text of 
your prompts and details about your MongoDB schemas are sent to 
Microsoft and OpenAI for processing. Your data is not stored on any 
third party storage systems or used to train AI models.
